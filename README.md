## 🧬 Periodic Table – A Masterpiece in Pure HTML

Welcome to the **Periodic Table reimagined** — a pixel-perfect simulation of the universe’s elemental blueprint, crafted with nothing but pure HTML. No CSS frameworks. No JavaScript. Just raw, structured HTML that breathes life into science.

This project transforms a basic web document into a **visual representation of atomic order**, blending chemical education with front-end fundamentals. Every element is color-coded by family, spaced with precision, and aligned to mirror the real-world periodic table — row by row, group by group, from **Hydrogen to Oganesson**.

> It’s not just a table — it’s a tribute to the elegance of both **science and code**.

Whether you're:
- A **student** exploring atomic structures,
- A **teacher** seeking a ready-to-use visual,
- Or a **developer** curious about HTML’s untapped visual power,

This table is designed to inspire.
